			<hr>
            <p class="lead">Tox began a few years ago, in the wake of Edward
            Snowden's leaks regarding NSA spying activity. The idea was to
            create an instant messaging protocol that ran without any kind of
            central servers. The system would be distributed, peer-to-peer, and
            encrypted end-to-end, with no way to disable any of the encryption
            features; at the same time, the protocol would be easily usable by
            the layperson with no practical knowledge of cryptography or
            distributed systems. Work began during the Summer of 2013 by a
            single anonymous developer (who continues, to this day, to remain
            anonymous). This lone developer put together a library implementing
            the Tox protocol. The library provides all of the messaging and
            encryption facilities, and is completely decoupled from any
            user-interface; for an end-user to make use of Tox, they need a Tox
            <i>client</i>. Fast-forward a few years to today, and there exist
            several independent Tox client projects, and the original Tox core
            library implementation is nearing completion (in terms of
            features). Tox (both core and clients) has thousands of users,
            hundreds of contributors, and the project shows no sign of slowing
            down. Recently, a group of some of the project's major contributors
            have formed <b>The Tox Project</b>, an organization built around
            the protection, promotion, and advancement of Tox and its development.</p>

			<h2 class="header">Our Purpose</h2>
			<br>
			<pre>The Tox Project shall exist for the purpose of advancing the state of secure
communication of the individual. The Tox Project shall further the development
of the Tox core library as its steward. The Tox Project will provide:

    * Funding for core developers, when reasonably within the organization budget
    * Maintenance of a published standard describing the Tox core protocol and library implementation
    * Maintenance of a published standard describing Tox client implementation guidelines

The Tox Project shall also be responsible for facilitating collaboration amongst
the various Tox core and client developers (collectively termed "Tox
developers" throughout the rest of this document) by providing platforms for
discussion between and among the two groups.

Lastly, The Tox Project will also provide (at its own discretion) at least the
following services, free-of-charge, to project groups utilizing the Tox core
library:

    * Build infrastructure
    * Binary and package distribution infrastructure
    * Documentation infrastructure
    * An outlet for public relations

The Tox Project shall ensure that its purpose and mode of operation remain within
the meaning of Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code.</pre>

            <p class="lead">The relationship of The Tox Project to Tox is
            analogous to the Linux Foundation's relationship to Linux. We're
            here to make it easier for everyone to develop and use Tox, and to
            promote free and secure exchange of information via the use of
            Tox.</p>
