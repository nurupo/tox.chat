			Tox began a few years ago, in the wake of Edward Snowden's leaks regarding NSA
			spying activity. The idea was to create an instant messaging application that
			ran without any kind of central servers. The system would be distributed,
			peer-to-peer, and end-to-end encrypted, with no way to disable any of the
			encryption features; at the same time, the application would be easily usable
			by the layperson with no practical knowledge of cryptography or distributed
			systems. During the Summer of 2013 a small group of developers from all around
			the globe was formed and began working on a library implementing the Tox
			protocol. The library provides all of the messaging and encryption facilities,
			and is completely decoupled from any user-interface; for an end-user to make
			use of Tox, they need a Tox client. Fast-forward a few years to today, and
			there exist several independent Tox client projects, and the original Tox core
			library implementation is continues improving. Tox (both core library and
			clients) has thousands of users, hundreds of contributors, and the project
			shows no sign of slowing down.

			Tox is a FOSS (Free and Open Source) project. All Tox code is open source and
			all development occurs in the open. Tox is developed by volunteer developers who
			spend their after work hours on it, believing in the idea of the project. Tox is
			not a company or any other legal organization. Currently we don't accept
			donations as a project, but you are welcome to reach out to developers
			individually.
